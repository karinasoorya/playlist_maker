# playlist_maker
This makes use of a few nifty Spotify API endpoints, from logging in to pulling playlists and then pulling audio features for each song to adding new playlists to a logged in user account. 

Pull songs from a playlist on Spotify with audio features of your choice to create a new playlist in your library! Want 
to pull all the 150 tempo and up songs that are super danceable from a dance playlist? You can do that now!

Instructions for Use: 

Register with Spotify dev to get a client key and client secret, generate a key for the seret_key to use sessions to enable storing the login token and running this web app. You'll need Flask and Python3 for this to run on your machine.
